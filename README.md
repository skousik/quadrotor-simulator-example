# Quadrotor Simulation Example

This example code sets up a Hummingbird quadrotor in the [simulator](https://github.com/skousik/simulator) framework. It creates an example trajectory, then lets the quadrotor track that trajectory.

## Get started

1. download the simulator repo: https://github.com/skousik/simulator
2. make sure the simulator repo and this quadrotor repo are on your path in MATLAB
3. run the `run_example` script
